# Aim
The aim of this project was to create an app which would show case all the skills I have learnt after following The Odin Project.

# Description
This app is a clone of a popular website called instagram. If you haven't heard of Instagram you probably never will becuase my version is likely to eclipse it over the coming weeks.
Jokes aside...

I am really happy with how this project turned out. I have been able to set up complex data models (which work!) and make a good looking front end. The site is not made for mobile but media queries have been used to give it a reasonable appearence.

There are endless features which I could add but it is time to move onto my next project. In the future I would like to add testing. This is something I have neglected in order to get the project to completion but I'd feel happier if I had tested along the way. I'm also a little disapointed how little js I;ve needed for this project but would like to look into how I could integrate vue compnents into Rails in the future.

# Other imporvements
- Search by full name, username or email and get non exact matches
- Add basic image filters for the posts
- regex for passwords and usernames
- Total refactor of partials and css which have become a little...damp
- Revise routes to bare essentials
- Add post upload to header
- Move the search feature out of the Tags controller...Shhhh! Don't tell anyone!
